# TDD Sessions for JavaScript(node)
I've divided the whole TDD session into six sessions. Where the first 2 sessions will help you to boost your motivation level towards the TDD, third and fourth session more about practical and fifth and sixth session more about how to implement TDD/Unit test with a real project.

Moreover, you can check below about focus points for the individual session.
